Here is large computational nanophysics project from an internship at the University of Technology at Troyes, France. 
I have included the code for the main program, developed by both me and Dr. Macias Guzman as well as a picture of the formula I derived for a barycentric approximation.
I also included a program for generation a curvature sensitive point cloud for Gielis' superformula, along with an indepth write up on the derivation of the equations used for the computational implementation. 
The point cloud  was fed to a third party mesh generator that was bootstrapped to the program.
